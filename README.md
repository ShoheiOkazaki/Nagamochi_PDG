This is a TOP HDA library for SideFX's Houdini.
There are some nodes for Maya, but those nodes are not perfect because I am not close to Maya. I'm looking forward to your advice!

# Requirement 
18.5 or higher

# Nodes
- nmMayaFileOpen
- nmMayaFileImport
- nmMayaAssExport
- nmMayaFileSave
- nmMayaRenderSettingsArnold
- nmCalcDirectorySize

# References
Highly recommend watching an excellent presentation from Pavel.
